Hello! I am Thomas. I am an Associate in Biomedical Informatics at the [HIDIVE Lab](https://hidivelab.org) at Harvard Medical School. Previously, I've received a [Bachelorâ€™s degree in Life Science & Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/lst/bsc-life-science-and-technology) and a [Master's degree in Biomedical Informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/masters-program). 

At the HIDIVE Lab, I specialize in accessibility for visual impairments for a grammar-based genomics visualization tool with [AltGosling](https://github.com/gosling-lang/altgosling). Furthermore, I explore visualization techniques for [cell compositions](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/cellpop), and contribute to development of integrated analyses in the data portal for the [HuBMAP consortium](https://hubmapconsortium.org).
